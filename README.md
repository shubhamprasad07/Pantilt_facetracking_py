# Pantilt_facetracking_py
Pantilt_face_tracking_py is an open-source project that enables face tracking using Arduino, servo motors, OpenCV, and Python. This project offers an affordable and accessible way to create a basic face tracking system that can be used for various applications, such as security systems, robotics, or interactive installations.

Features:

Face Detection: The project leverages the OpenCV library to detect and track human faces in real-time from a camera feed.

Arduino Integration: Utilizing an Arduino board, the project controls two servo motors that can pan and tilt a camera in response to the detected face's movement.

Servo Control: The system enables precise control of the pan and tilt angles, ensuring the camera follows the face smoothly.

Python Script: The core functionality is implemented in a Python script, making it easy to set up and modify for your specific requirements.

Real-time Tracking: The system continuously tracks the detected face in real-time, adjusting the camera position as the face moves within the frame.

Customization: The project is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust parameters, such as tracking sensitivity and camera movement range, to suit their specific needs.

Open-Source: Pantilt_face_tracking_py is open-source, providing a foundation for developers to build upon and enhance. Contributions and improvements from the community are encouraged.

Usage:

Install the required libraries and dependencies as specified in the project documentation.
Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
Connect the servo motors to the Arduino as per the project's wiring instructions.
Run the Python script on your computer.
The camera will start tracking faces within its field of view, adjusting its position as necessary.
